# Active-Training on the MNIST-Dataset

In this project we explored some approaches using active-training to build classifiers with very little data labels.

Problem Setup:
- Build the best possible classifier with only 500 image labels
- All of MNIST can be used without labels for unsupervised pre-training
- The 500 labels also include the test data

## Approaches

### Clustering

### Active-CNN

### Active-CNN + Contrastive Pre-Training

## Results

| Model                     | Accuracy | 95% CI |
|---------------------------|----------|--------|
| CNN                       |          |        |
| Clustering                |          |        |
| Active-CNN                |          |        |
| Active-CNN (pre-training) |          |        |
